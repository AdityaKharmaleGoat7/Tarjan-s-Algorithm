# Bridge Detection in Graphs
This repository contains a C++ program that detects bridges in an undirected graph using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

# Introduction
Bridges are edges in a graph whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the graph. They play a crucial role in network analysis and can represent critical links that, if broken, can cause network disruptions. The purpose of this program is to identify and output the bridges present in an undirected graph.

The program is implemented using the following key components:

Depth-first search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Discovery time and low value: These values are used to determine the presence of bridges during the DFS traversal.
Adjacency list: An efficient data structure used to represent the graph.

# Dependencies
The program is implemented in C++ and requires the following dependencies:

C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
Standard Template Library (STL)

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code file.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
Provide the edge connections between nodes as per the prompt.
The program will output the bridges present in the graph.
